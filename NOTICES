Conformance Test:
Security -> UaPkiCertificate.publicKeyFromDER() varies from test to test (CreateSession.js)
Security -> UaPkiCertificate.publicKeyFromDER() error (identity.js) in buildUserNameIdentityToken

Discovery Get Endpoints -> No Issue

Discovery Find Servers Self -> No Issue

Address Space Base ->
1)  Address Space scanning based on pulling first reference and following that.
    However, the server has at least 2+ cyclic components.
    -   PropertyType (VariableType) via HasProperty to NodeVersion
        NodeVersion via HasTypeDefinition to PropertyType
        * This cyclic has been patched to not attach NodeVersion to PropertyType
    -   Mandatory (ModellingRuleType) via HasProperty to NodeVersion
        NodeVersion via HasModellingRule to Mandatory
        * This is caused by force inheritance of NodeVersion between Types
        * Can be solved by changing NodeVersion to be Optional
2)  Altered 002.js test to account for the HasEncoding reference on DataTypes

Address Space Write Mask
1)  Documentation and implementation differs (scalar as OPPOSED TO ARRAY)

Base Info Core Structure -> No Issue

View Basic
1)  005.js, 016.js, 020.js test case - does not account for the fact that Browse() can return other ReferenceTypes
2)  015.js basically passed the test, just got a warning on the logging check
3)  015.js - requires the parent's type Reference to exist for the test to completely succeed
4)  019.js - incomplete test with NodeIdSettings.References not defined

View TranslateBrowsePath
1)  Err-002.js - reduce max browse depth
2)  Err-024.js - comparison against 1600 will always fail time evaluation

View Minimum Continuation Point 1
1)  011.js - reference subtype bullshit issue
2)  Err-010 - comparison against time 1600-01-01 will always fail
3)  015.js - server does not have two views
4)  012.js - Method ns=1;i=1001 does not have 2+ method references
    012.js - View lacks current switch statement and executing with NodeClassMask equal to 12

View Register Nodes
1)  Err-009 & Err-014 - comparison against time 1600-01-01 will always fail
2)  013.js, 014.js, 015.js - do not have sufficient nodeIds so tests were skipped

Method
1)  break loop in calculating the parent node is not evaluated properly

Attribute Write Values
1)  LocalizedText has no minValue but still error!

Security User Anonymous
1)  002.js - require findAnonymous intiial setting to null
