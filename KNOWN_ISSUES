Working constraints of the current implementation:

+)  ExtensionObject - may need to initialize one dimension array with a dummy element
+)  ValueRank Any or 2D are not currently supported
+)  Changing the datatype of a Variable between primitives is not currently supported 
        possibly, in the future, will completely reset the target variant on Write() 
        and reinitialize the Variant with target value
+)  NodeIds are not supported on a greater ServerIndex
+)  Types must be statically created within the OPC Foundation's EncodeableObject system
+)  Currently only SINGLE locale supported
+)  Organizes Reference only copied IF THE TYPES MATCH
+) Browse() View Maintenance REQUIRES 1 level matching & lacks View versioning
+) NodeIds numeric are guaranteed to work, other NodeId types uncertain

+) ValueAsText property is created...but not yet finished evaluating the valueastext dynamically
+) Indexer() will overroll at UInt32 Max...
+) Session Diagnostics information not created properly (requires mutex) (although don't have to create if Diagnostics TURNED OFF
